General format is: contributor, github handle, email. In some cases, the contributor field is an organization instead of an actual person---this is for cases where the work was done on behalf of the organization, ie as part of their job. In others, no contributor field and/or email is shown---this is because this list was partially (mostly) reconstructed from github commit information and the person's real life name and email are unknown.
